Construction data search:
Hello fellow San Diegans. If you have lived here for any amount of time, you probably have seen construction being done on the roads everywhere. You canâ€™t drive a few miles until you reach one. If seeing one was a game, then it 
would be Mission Impossible. You might also wonder, what are they doing, how long have they been doing it? Well for that, I propose a solution. A search site dedicated to cataloguing and finding construction on the road. This 
will help people not only what is going on, but to give them a broader picture on why they are doing it.
