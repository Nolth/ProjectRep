Disease Simulation:
Greetings everyone. As you are already aware, Diseases have been a part of our history for a very long time. Throughout history, there has been no greater threat, other than ourselves, to humanity. While many know the dangers, 
many don’t know how truly dangerous they are, so that is why I propose a Disease Simulation called Germ Spreader. This simulation, created in Eclipse, will help people understand more about how Diseases spread, and how deadly 
they truly are. 

Construction data search:
Hello fellow San Diegans. If you have lived here for any amount of time, you probably have seen construction being done on the roads everywhere. You can’t drive a few miles until you reach one. If seeing one was a game, then it 
would be Mission Impossible. You might also wonder, what are they doing, how long have they been doing it? Well for that, I propose a solution. A search site dedicated to cataloguing and finding construction on the road. This 
will help people not only what is going on, but to give them a broader picture on why they are doing it.
